This specialization consists of five courses, covering essential Python topics:

1. **[Programming for Everybody - Getting Started w/ Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python)**  
   - Introduction to Python programming, including variables, expressions, functions, loops, and conditionals.
2. **[Python Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python)**  
   - Covers fundamental data structures like strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples.
3. **[Using Python to Access Web Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data?specialization=python)**  
   - Learn how to scrape and work with web data using Python libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
4. **[Using Databases with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases?specialization=python)**  
   - Introduction to SQL and using Python to interact with relational databases.
5. **[Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-visualization?specialization=python)**  
   - The final project where you build a search engine that retrieves, processes, and visualizes data.
